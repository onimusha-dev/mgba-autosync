## 🕹️ Pokemon GBA

> I played these during programming when I was bored [:P](https://discord.gg/QcHQKYw2ex)

This repo exists so I can:
- Sync my GBA save files across devices
- Occasionally escape reality for 20 minutes
- Pretend I’m still 10 and nothing hurts

---

### 🎮 Games Included
Just the `.sav` files and maybe some ROM configs (no copyrighted stuff).

---

### 🧠 Why?
Because deep focus sometimes needs dumb distractions.
Also Git is cheaper than cloud storage lol.

---

### 📡 Autosync Setup
Uses a cronjob + shell script to auto-commit saves like a dev-ops addicted Ash Ketchum.

### 💬 Talk to me?
Hit the Discord: [:P](https://discord.gg/QcHQKYw2ex)
